# Deep-Learning-Text-Generator
This is a little neural net that I created to better study and understand deep learning

**Current State:** Training works fine, and will generate data after it is done, but saving and loading back a model is broken.

To train a model, run this bat file:

`train.bat` or `python model.py train`

To generate text data, run this bat file:

`generate.bat` or `python model.py generate --weights="model.h5"`
